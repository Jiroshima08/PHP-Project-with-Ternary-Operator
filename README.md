# Simple PHP-Project-with-Ternary-Operator

LOVE EXPERT AMEN
LOVE EXPERT AMEN is a playful PHP web application that humorously evaluates your "simpness" level based on your mood and provides personalized advice. It demonstrates the use of core PHP control structures such as conditionals, loops, and arrays, with an additional bonus of the ternary operator to enhance functionality.

Features:
Conditional Statements (if, else): Determines the mood level and generates responses based on user input.

Loops (for, while, do-while): Ranks your simpness level and provides repeated heart icons based on your input.

foreach Loop: Iterates over an array of motivational advice.

Ternary Operator: Conditionally displays a bonus tip based on the userâ€™s choice.

How it Works:
The user inputs their mood level (1-10) and chooses if they want a rizz tip.

The application ranks their simpness from 1 to their chosen mood level, displaying personalized responses.

Additional advice, wisdom, and a bonus tip are displayed depending on the mood level and whether the user opted for extra tips.

Example Output:
A simpness ranking is displayed, with messages like "You're an even bigger simp than I thought" or "You chose yourself over love."

Personalized tips and wisdom on love are displayed, along with a cheeky bonus tip if the user opts for it.
